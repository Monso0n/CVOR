# CVOR-finalized-
CVOR (Computer Vision Object Recognition) highlights objects using cascades and the OpenCV Library

To use CVOR, RUN GUI2.PY. This will launch the GUI for the program. From here, check the boxes for the objects that you would like to detect. Select an image file from your computer, and click run. A new window will pop up, highlighting the detected objects along with the name of the cascade. 

CVOR is built in Python. The GUI is built upon Tkinter. The object recognition is processed by the OpenCV library. The cascades utilized are haarcascades(from: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades).
